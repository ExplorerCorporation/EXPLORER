<h1>EXPLORER™ Project</h1>

<p>EXPLORER™ is a largest media database about materials, objects and events of this world. There you can see an information about any object in the world, observe the world map and history, order some paid services and even make money.</p>
<p>Once you're opening one of our server URLs in your web browser, it opening you the directory view of root directory of shared folder of selected EXPLORER™ server. There you can open any folder or file from any directory on any server of our project. There's so many materials from this world. You can search for any material, object or event you want, then you can select an appropriate folder in this project.
<p>Moreover, you can also add something to this project by opening upload.html file right from the directory view of this project. Choose file from your device, type a folder in the project (empty value meaning root directory of this project) and tap the Upload button. To check this file in this project, you can go back to root directory of selected EXPLORER™ server and find your file in entered server directory.</p>
<p>Stop storing your personal data in your device. First, it uses places on their disks, and second, it's so uncomfortable. If you want to access your data in various devices, it's no need to store them copied to each other. All you need to do is check your Internet connection and access to one of our servers, entering the URL on your web browser by the following formula:</p>
<p>"http://" & 4-digit 16-n (Hex) number & ".explorer.com"</p>

<h2>Brief information about EXPLORER™ Project</h2>

<p>EXPLORER™ is a universal and international research, investigation and educational project created by the World Government. People can use this project to store and access their personal files right in it, learn any information about the real world, but the World Government uses this project to gather information about all people, countries, objects and events in the world, and control them.</p>
<p>Like Internet, the World Government is decentralized network. Internet allows you to know more than mass media gives to you, to let you get only what you want. So, the World Government was launched a new Internet project that allows you to get anything you want, from information and knowledge about the real world to goods and material resources.</p>

<h2>History of the EXPLORER™ Project</h2>

<em>For the detail information about versions and history of this project, check this <a href="Explorerpedia/versions.txt">file</a>.</em>
<p>EXPLORER™ Project was created in 2014. But the thoughts about to create this project was a very long time ago. The English noble Johnsons family had an idea about to create an universal project that can store various information about the real world and share it to other people. They are members of the World Government and their predecessor Sir John Johnson was a member of the masonic lodge of New York.</p>
<p>Their family member Adam was born in 1998 in Montreal, Canada, and his mom was immigrated to Russia to fulfil the main mission of the family. He was studied in the Russian Far East, and while he was studied he couldn't create this project. The creation of this project was started in 2014 when was started Euromaidan in Ukraine and Russia was occupated the Crimea. Young Adam wasn't pleased by this and created the EXPLORER™ Project to start gathering information about the real world and provide security to the family, which part in Russia was in the serious danger.</p>

<h2>EXPLORER™ system all around the world</h2>

<p>EXPLORER™ Project has so many servers all around the world. Each EXPLORER™ server has the same EXPLORER™ Project structure, but has only different IP addresses and URLs. Their total amount around the world is 10000, each server has his own hexadecimal ID, vary from 0000 to FFFF. Their ID is their own computer names with explorer.com domain. Each EXPLORER™ chip has his own LED sensor screen. To on/off him, you can tap him to his on-screen button. This LED shows your username, money sum and status bar. EXPLORER™ chip has built-in radio modem to transfer data to all EXPLORER™ servers in the world by their URL addresses located in any chip, disk to store your user data and chip program to work with transactions and transfers to one of EXPLORER™ servers. Each EXPLORER™ server has a program to upload EXPLORER™ Project folder located on each of those servers to all other EXPLORER™ servers by their URL addresses, written in this program located on each EXPLORER™ server. It makes files on those servers undestroyable, and even if one of those servers will be destroyed, other servers of the EXPLORER™ will be available. Plus, third-party people and organizations can create EXPLORER™ server anywhere else with URL consist of available 4-digit 16-n (Hex) number using any available IP address, using EXPLORER™ franchise. Internet and the World Government are country and territory independent, and can settle and work anywhere. Internet can provide people the information they want, but EXPLORER™ makes it find and access easier, opening files right in your browser.</p>

<p>We're selling our franchise all over the world, with hardware and software in special stores. This store can be opened in any country where we're planning to create EXPLORER™ servers.</p>
